(Blender Render of KiCad Exported PCB)

## Introduction

This is a step by step of how I export my PCBs from KiCad and then import them into Blender in order to produce fancy looking renders. Most of it is based on this [fantastic 4.5 hour video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pjr0xkuyhU) by {{< person url="https://twitter.com/diconx" name="Sebastian Staacks" picture="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1439617218585763844/L4gtnhTs_400x400.jpg" >}} however a few things have become simpler due to KiCad doing a better job at exporting. If you get stuck I recommend watching the video, I have summarized what I use but there is a lot of good information in the video especially if you aren't very familiar with Blender.

## Preparation in KiCad

In order to get good results and make your life easier I recommend you make a few changes in KiCad before you export the 3d file.

### 3d Models

Add 3d models to all your parts. Most common built-in KiCad parts (resistors, capacitors etc.) have models but you will need to add models for the parts that don't. 

Easiest is to just import a step or wrl file of the part in the "3D Models" tab in the footprint properties (PCB View). If you have made your own footprint I recommend you define this under the properties of the custom footprint then it will be available everywhere you used this part.

{{< admonition info "Note" true >}}
Important here is to position the part correctly. Make sure it doesn't not touch the PCB or any part of a hole if applicable. There should be a bit of a cap so that we can then split the part off in Blender. I have not had to edit any built-in KiCad parts as the gab was big enough.

### Export
Check in the 3d view that everything is the way you want.

Now export the 3d model of the entire PCB with the following options set:

This is an export from KiCad into Blender which textures applied as well as animated.
