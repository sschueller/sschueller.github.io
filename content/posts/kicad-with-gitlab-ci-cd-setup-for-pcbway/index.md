As I was writing this article PCBWay happened to contact me and offered to sponsor some of my PCBs in exchange for a mention.

So technically this is sponsored content.

UPDATE `access_level_list_sizes` WHERE id IN (SELECT al.id
FROM `access_level_list_sizes` AS al
LEFT JOIN events AS e ON e.id = al.event_id
WHERE `access_level_id` = '6' AND `list_type_id` = '1' AND `size` > '0' AND e.date > 20231128
) SET size = 0;
