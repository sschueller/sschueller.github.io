## Introduction

I needed some blinds for the window in front of my desk so i found these (cheap)[https://www.obi.ch/rollos-raffrollos/gardinia-easyfix-rollo-uni-hellgrau-struktur-150-x-45-cm/p/1799493] ones at the local hardware store. They work great but I requires me to climb over my desk top operate them. So I deced to go down the rabbit hole to convert them to electronic shades...

## Research

Since these types of blinds are quite common I assumed I would find some existing project on thingiverse or other site. Indeed I found a few projects that control similar type shades with chain but nothing really fit for what I wanted.
